# MNIST_Object_Localization
This project aims to apply object localization techniques to the MNIST dataset. The original dataset consists of images with a size of 28x28 pixels. However, to implement object localization techniques on this dataset, I preprocessed the data to a size of 75x75 pixels. The model creation process utilizes TensorFlow as the main tool.
